# Hydro-Kinetics Robotics Team

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Hydro-Kinetics Robotics Team!

## Who Are We?
We are a group of homeschool students.

## What Are We Here To Do?
We are here to compete in the [MATE ROV Ranger Division](https://materovcompetition.org/ranger). The MATE ROV Competition is an underwater robotics, either remotely operated vehicle or ROV challenge, that engages a global community of learners each year. 

## When Is This Happening?
Details regarding the competition are expected to be posted in September with the competition in April.

## Where Are We?
Currently, we are being hosted by CEDAR, which is hosted by Riverside Church.

## Why?
Is a love of robotics, that intricate, irrational, and irratating subject not enough?
